## 🚀 Getting Started

### Python Projects
```bash
cd python
python <filename>.py
```

### Java Projects
```bash
cd java
javac <filename>.java
java <ClassName>
```

For the Space Shooter game:
```bash
cd java/SpaceShooter
javac *.java
java java.SpaceShooter.SpaceShooter
```

### C Projects
```bash
cd C
gcc helloWorldIn.c -o helloWorldIn
./helloWorldIn
```

## 📝 Notes

- Projects are organized by programming language
- Each project is self-contained and can be run independently
- Some projects may require specific dependencies (e.g., Java Swing for Space Shooter)
